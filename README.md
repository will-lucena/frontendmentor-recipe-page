## My process

I followed a mobile-first workflow, so first I understood the areas in the mobile layout, break it into components and then started adding the html tags. Once I've finished this markup process I started the styling, creating a css file and doing the components I've visualized before styles.

After finish the mobile version, I splited the files into mobile.css and desktop.css, using media query to add the desktop layout with it's adjustments.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I started doing it because of an website for recipes ideia, so I'll use this layout and code as base to the recipe page that will be acessed by a direct url or recipes list page, loading data from a with api. The full website will include recipes list, user's profile, login, a generate image from html feature to share and etc
